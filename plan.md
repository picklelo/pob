# Poetry Collection App - UI Refinement ‚úÖ

## Project Overview
Remove the reading mode button and fix poem formatting to properly handle stanzas.

---

## Phase 1: Remove Reading Mode Button ‚úÖ
- [x] Remove the book-open icon button from poem detail page header
- [x] Remove `reading_mode` state variable
- [x] Remove `toggle_reading_mode` event handler
- [x] Remove all conditional rendering based on `reading_mode`
- [x] Simplify layout to always show standard view (no more centering/hiding elements)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Reading mode toggle has been removed for a simpler, cleaner interface.

---

## Phase 2: Fix Poem Stanza Formatting ‚úÖ
- [x] Add `poem_stanzas` computed var to group lines by empty line breaks
- [x] Update poem rendering to use simple paragraph elements with whitespace-pre-line
- [x] Fix rendering approach to avoid complex nested lambdas
- [x] Apply proper styling (text-xl, line-height 1.8, space-y-6 between stanzas)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Poems now display with proper stanza formatting. Single newlines stay within the same paragraph, and only empty lines create stanza breaks.
