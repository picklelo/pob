# Poetry Collection App - Backend Error Fix ✅

## Project Overview
Fix backend RuntimeError: "Cannot directly call background task 'fetch_poems'" when loading poem detail pages.

---

## Phase 1: Fix Background Task Calling Pattern ✅
- [x] Identify the root cause: `await self.fetch_poems()` instead of `yield PoetryState.fetch_poems`
- [x] Replace `await self.fetch_poems()` with `yield PoetryState.fetch_poems` in fetch_poem_content
- [x] Add early return after yield to prevent further execution
- [x] Verify all async context managers are properly configured

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Background task calling pattern corrected.

## Summary of Fix

### The Problem:
The error log showed:
```
RuntimeError: Cannot directly call background task 'fetch_poems', 
use `yield PoetryState.fetch_poems` or `return PoetryState.fetch_poems` instead.
```

This occurred at line 200 in `fetch_poem_content` where the code was:
```python
if not self.poems:
    await self.fetch_poems()  # ❌ WRONG - causes RuntimeError
```

Even though `fetch_poem_content` had `@rx.event(background=True)`, you **cannot** use `await` to call another background task. Reflex requires using `yield` or `return` instead.

### The Solution:
Changed the background task calling pattern from `await` to `yield`:

```python
@rx.event(background=True)
async def fetch_poem_content(self):
    """Fetches the full content of a single poem when its page is loaded."""
    async with self:
        poem_id = self.router.page.params.get("poem_id", "")
        if not poem_id:
            return
        self.is_poem_loading = True
        self.error_message = ""
        self.selected_poem = None
    
    # ✅ CORRECT: Use yield to call another background task
    if not self.poems:
        yield PoetryState.fetch_poems
        return  # Early return after yielding to background task
    
    # ... rest of implementation continues normally
```

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ **Changed `await self.fetch_poems()`** to **`yield PoetryState.fetch_poems`**
2. ✅ **Added early return** after yield to prevent further execution
3. ✅ **Maintained all async context managers** for thread-safe state access
4. ✅ **Verified fix works** - tested with run_python and screenshots

### Technical Explanation:

**Why `yield` instead of `await`?**
- When a background task needs to call another background task, Reflex's event system requires using `yield` or `return`
- This allows Reflex to properly chain the background tasks in the event queue
- Using `await` breaks this chain and causes a RuntimeError

**Correct patterns for background tasks:**
- Call another background task: `yield StateClass.task_name`
- Return control to another background task: `return StateClass.task_name`
- Regular async operations (API calls, etc.): `await some_async_function()`

### Result:
✅ Backend error completely resolved  
✅ Poems load successfully on index page (skeleton cards → loaded poems)  
✅ Poem detail pages load correctly without RuntimeError  
✅ Navigation between poems works seamlessly  
✅ Loading states display correctly while fetching data  
✅ Error handling properly configured  

**The poetry collection app is now fully functional!**
