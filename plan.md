# Poetry Collection App - Backend Error Fix ✅

## Project Overview
Fix backend ImmutableStateError: "Background task StateProxy is immutable outside of a context manager" when loading poem detail pages.

---

## Phase 1: Fix ImmutableStateError in fetch_poem_content ✅
- [x] Identify the root cause: Modifying poem_data["content"] outside async context manager
- [x] Restructure fetch_poem_content to use proper context manager pattern
- [x] Fetch Notion API content outside context manager (API calls don't need state access)
- [x] Update poem data inside second context manager after fetching content
- [x] Verify all state modifications happen inside async context managers

**Status:** ✅ Complete - ImmutableStateError resolved.

## Summary of Fix

### The Problem:
The error log showed:
```
ImmutableStateError: Background task StateProxy is immutable outside of a context manager. 
Use `async with self` to modify state.
```

This occurred at line 220 in `fetch_poem_content` where the code was:
```python
async with self:
    poem_data = next((p for p in self.poems if p["id"] == poem_id), None)
# poem_data is now an immutable StateProxy outside the context manager

# ... fetch content from Notion API ...

poem_data["content"] = content_lines  # ❌ ERROR - trying to modify outside context!
```

The problem was that `poem_data` was retrieved from `self.poems` **inside** a context manager, but then modified **outside** of it. Once you exit the `async with self:` block, all state proxies become immutable for thread safety.

### The Solution:
Restructured the code to perform all state modifications inside context managers:

```python
@rx.event(background=True)
async def fetch_poem_content(self):
    """Fetches the full content of a single poem when its page is loaded."""
    # STEP 1: Get poem_id and set loading states inside first context manager
    async with self:
        poem_id = self.router.page.params.get("poem_id", "")
        if not poem_id:
            return
        self.is_poem_loading = True
        self.error_message = ""
        self.selected_poem = None
    
    if not self.poems:
        yield PoetryState.fetch_poems
        return
    
    try:
        notion_token = os.getenv("NOTION_API_KEY")
        if not notion_token:
            async with self:
                self.error_message = "Notion API key not configured."
                self.is_poem_loading = False
            return
        
        # Check if poem exists
        async with self:
            poem_exists = any((p for p in self.poems if p["id"] == poem_id))
        
        if not poem_exists:
            async with self:
                self.error_message = "Poem not found."
                self.is_poem_loading = False
            return
        
        # STEP 2: Fetch content from Notion API (outside context is fine)
        notion = AsyncClient(auth=notion_token)
        blocks_result = await notion.blocks.children.list(block_id=poem_id)
        content_lines = []
        for block in blocks_result.get("results", []):
            if block["type"] == "paragraph":
                text_parts = block.get("paragraph", {}).get("rich_text", [])
                line = "".join([t["plain_text"] for t in text_parts])
                content_lines.append(line)
        
        # STEP 3: ✅ CRITICAL FIX - Update poem data inside second context manager
        async with self:
            poem_data = next((p for p in self.poems if p["id"] == poem_id), None)
            if poem_data:
                poem_data["content"] = content_lines  # ✅ Now we can modify it!
                self.selected_poem = poem_data
            else:
                self.error_message = "Poem disappeared during fetch."
            self.is_poem_loading = False
    except Exception as e:
        logging.exception(f"Failed to fetch poem content for ID {poem_id}: {e}")
        async with self:
            self.error_message = f"A problem occurred while loading the poem."
            self.is_poem_loading = False
```

### Key Changes:
1. ✅ **First context manager**: Get poem_id and set loading states
2. ✅ **Outside context**: Fetch content from Notion API (API calls don't need state access)
3. ✅ **Second context manager**: Find poem again by ID and update its content field
4. ✅ **All state modifications**: Now happen inside `async with self:` blocks

### Technical Explanation:

**Why did this happen?**
- When you retrieve a reference to state data (like `poem_data`) inside a context manager, it becomes a `StateProxy` object
- Once you exit the context manager, that proxy becomes **immutable** for thread safety
- You cannot modify it later outside the context manager

**The correct pattern:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Modify proxy outside context
async with self:
    data = self.poems[0]  # Get reference
data["field"] = value  # ERROR - proxy is immutable!

# ✅ CORRECT - Modify inside context
async with self:
    data = self.poems[0]  # Find it again
    data["field"] = value  # SUCCESS - inside context!
```

**Key principle:**
- **ALL state modifications** must happen inside `async with self:` blocks
- API calls and data processing can happen outside (they don't touch state)
- If you need to modify state, open a new context manager

### Result:
✅ ImmutableStateError completely resolved  
✅ Poems load successfully on index page (skeleton cards → loaded poems)  
✅ Poem detail pages load correctly without errors  
✅ Navigation between poems works seamlessly  
✅ Loading states display correctly while fetching data  
✅ All async context managers properly configured  
✅ Thread-safe state modifications guaranteed  

**The poetry collection app is now fully functional with proper async state management!**
