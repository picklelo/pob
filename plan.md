# Poetry Collection App - Navigation Fix âœ…

## Project Overview
Fix prev/next navigation buttons and direct URL access issues on poem detail pages.

---

## Phase 1: Fix Navigation Links âœ…
- [x] Replace button event handlers with direct anchor links
- [x] Change from `on_click` with lambdas to `href` attributes
- [x] Use `/poem/{poem_id}` direct links for prev/next navigation
- [x] Remove complex lambda closure issues by using simple hrefs
- [x] Test navigation logic with sorted poems

**Status:** âœ… Complete - Navigation now uses direct links instead of event handlers, fixing the lambda closure issue.

---

## Phase 2: Fix Direct URL Access & Page Refresh âœ…
- [x] Ensure `fetch_poem_content` properly sets `selected_poem` early
- [x] Fix computed vars to work correctly when page loads directly
- [x] Handle case where poems list needs to be fetched first
- [x] Set `selected_poem` immediately after finding poem data
- [x] Ensure navigation buttons render correctly on page load

**Status:** âœ… Complete - Direct URLs and page refreshes now work properly. The poem content loads correctly and navigation links are available.

## âœ… ALL FIXES COMPLETE

### Summary of Changes:

**ðŸ”— Navigation Links Fixed**
- Changed prev/next buttons from `on_click` event handlers to `href` anchor links
- Navigation now uses simple `/poem/{poem_id}` URLs
- Eliminates lambda closure issues that prevented IDs from being passed correctly
- Links work with browser back/forward navigation
- Better for SEO and user experience

**ðŸ”„ Direct URL Access Fixed**
- `fetch_poem_content` now properly sets `selected_poem` before fetching full content
- Navigation computed vars (`prev_poem`, `next_poem`, `current_poem_index`) work correctly on page load
- Handles the case where poems list needs to be fetched first
- Page refreshes and direct URL access now work reliably

**âœ… What Now Works:**
- âœ… Clicking prev/next links navigates correctly between poems
- âœ… Refreshing a poem page loads and displays correctly
- âœ… Direct URL access (e.g., `/poem/abc123`) works properly
- âœ… Navigation buttons show correct prev/next poem titles
- âœ… Poem counter shows correct position (e.g., "2 of 5")
- âœ… Browser back/forward buttons work as expected

**ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details:**
- Removed `go_to_poem` event handler (no longer needed)
- Navigation is now handled entirely by href links
- State management simplified - no complex event chains
- `fetch_poem_content` uses `router.page.params` to get poem_id from URL
- Early `selected_poem` assignment ensures computed vars work immediately
