# Poetry Collection App - Dynamic Route Loading Fix ✅

## Project Overview
Fix dynamic route `/poem/[poem_id]` not loading poems correctly when accessed directly via URL.

---

## Phase 1: Use on_load for Server-Side Data Loading ✅
- [x] Move fetch_poem_content from on_mount to on_load parameter in add_page
- [x] Ensure on_load runs server-side before page renders
- [x] Add conditional rendering to check if selected_poem exists before showing content
- [x] Verify page stays on poem route after on_load completes

**Status:** ✅ Complete - Using on_load for proper server-side data fetching.

---

## Phase 2: Test Direct URL Access ✅
- [x] Test navigating directly to /poem/[poem_id] URL
- [x] Verify poem content loads and displays
- [x] Check that navigation links work correctly
- [x] Ensure page doesn't redirect to homepage

**Status:** ✅ Complete - All tests passed. Direct URL access working perfectly.

## Summary of Changes

### What Was Fixed:
The dynamic route `/poem/[poem_id]` was not loading poems correctly when accessed directly via URL. The page was rendering before the poem data was fetched, causing it to show the homepage instead.

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Moved to on_load**: Changed from `on_mount` in the component to `on_load` parameter in `app.add_page()`:
   ```python
   app.add_page(
       poem_detail_page, 
       route="/poem/[poem_id]", 
       on_load=PoetryState.fetch_poem_content
   )
   ```

2. **Added conditional rendering**: Wrapped poem content in `rx.cond(PoetryState.selected_poem, ...)` to only render when poem is loaded.

3. **Proper loading states**: Added `is_poem_loading` state to show skeleton loading UI while content is being fetched.

### Result:
✅ Direct URL access now works correctly
✅ Poem content loads and displays properly
✅ Navigation between poems works seamlessly
✅ No more redirect to homepage issue

The implementation is complete and tested successfully!
