# Poetry Collection App - Dynamic Route Loading Fix

## Project Overview
Fix dynamic route `/poem/[poem_id]` not loading poems correctly when accessed directly via URL.

---

## Phase 1: Use on_load for Server-Side Data Loading âœ…
- [x] Move fetch_poem_content from on_mount to on_load parameter in add_page
- [x] Ensure on_load runs server-side before page renders
- [x] Add conditional rendering to check if selected_poem exists before showing content
- [x] Verify page stays on poem route after on_load completes

**Status:** âœ… Complete - Using on_load for proper server-side data fetching.

---

## Phase 2: Test Direct URL Access
- [ ] Test navigating directly to /poem/[poem_id] URL
- [ ] Verify poem content loads and displays
- [ ] Check that navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Ensure page doesn't redirect to homepage

**Status:** ðŸ”„ In Progress - Testing implementation.

## What Changed:

1. **Moved to on_load**: Changed from `on_mount` in the component to `on_load` parameter in `app.add_page()`:
   ```python
   app.add_page(
       poem_detail_page, 
       route="/poem/[poem_id]", 
       on_load=PoetryState.fetch_poem_content
   )
   ```

2. **Added conditional rendering**: Wrapped poem content in `rx.cond(PoetryState.selected_poem, ...)` to only render when poem is loaded.

3. **Simplified state logic**: Removed unnecessary state updates that were causing issues.

**Next**: Test that direct URL access works correctly and poem content displays.
