# Poetry Collection App - Dynamic Route Loading Fix ‚úÖ

## Project Overview
Fix dynamic route `/poem/[poem_id]` not loading poems correctly when accessed directly via URL.

---

## Phase 1: Diagnose State Context Issue ‚úÖ
- [x] Identify that after `yield PoetryState.fetch_poems`, code accesses old state context
- [x] Understand that `async with self:` creates a fresh state context
- [x] Recognize that `self.poems` must be re-read after yield completes
- [x] Document the root cause of the "Poem not found" error

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Issue identified: After yielding to fetch_poems, the code was accessing the OLD state context where self.poems was still empty.

---

## Phase 2: Fix State Context Access ‚úÖ
- [x] Add `async with self:` block before checking if poems are loaded
- [x] Add `async with self:` block after yield to access updated poems list
- [x] Ensure poem lookup happens in the fresh state context
- [x] Properly handle state updates with TypedDict copying

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - State context properly managed throughout fetch_poem_content.

---

## Phase 3: Test and Verify Fix ‚úÖ
- [x] Verify the updated flow works correctly
- [x] Confirm poems are found after fetch_poems completes
- [x] Test that navigation links render with correct poem data
- [x] Update plan documentation

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete - Dynamic routes now load poems correctly!

## ‚úÖ ALL FIXES COMPLETE

### Summary of Changes:

**üîß Root Cause:**
When navigating directly to `/poem/[poem_id]`, the `fetch_poem_content` event handler would:
1. Check if `self.poems` is empty
2. If empty, `yield PoetryState.fetch_poems` to load poems
3. **‚ùå PROBLEM**: Try to find the poem in `self.poems` using the OLD state context
4. Since the poems list wasn't refreshed in the current context, it was still empty
5. Result: "Poem not found" error

**‚úÖ Solution:**
After `yield PoetryState.fetch_poems`, we must re-enter the state context with `async with self:` to access the UPDATED `self.poems` list that was just populated by `fetch_poems`.

**Key Changes in `fetch_poem_content`:**

```python
# BEFORE (broken):
if not self.poems:
    yield PoetryState.fetch_poems
# Access self.poems here - still empty! ‚ùå

# AFTER (fixed):
async with self:
    poems_loaded = bool(self.poems)
if not poems_loaded:
    yield PoetryState.fetch_poems
# Now access poems in fresh context
async with self:
    found_poem = next((p for p in self.poems if p["id"] == poem_id), None)
    # self.poems is now populated! ‚úÖ
```

**‚úÖ What Now Works:**
- ‚úÖ Direct URL access to `/poem/[poem_id]` loads the poem correctly
- ‚úÖ Page refreshes on poem pages work perfectly
- ‚úÖ Navigation links show correct prev/next poem titles
- ‚úÖ Poem content loads and displays properly
- ‚úÖ All computed vars (prev_poem, next_poem, current_poem_index) work correctly
- ‚úÖ No more "Poem not found" errors

**üéØ Technical Details:**
- `async with self:` creates a new state context that reflects the latest state changes
- After background task delegation with `yield`, always re-enter state context to access updated state
- This is a critical pattern when one background task depends on data from another
- State updates made by `fetch_poems` are only visible in a fresh `async with self:` block

**üìö Lesson Learned:**
When using `yield` to delegate to another background task that modifies state, you MUST re-enter the state context with `async with self:` to see those modifications. The state context is not automatically updated after the yield completes.
